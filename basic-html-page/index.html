    <h1>Thoughts on HTML's Utility</h1>
    <p>In my opinion, HTML is important because it allows everyone with an internet connection to access any type of information they need quickly without needing to pay for anything. HTML allows the access of these information at anytime they want. With the birth of the internet and HTML, the world became a place that is more connection and up to date with information. This spurred on various types of innovations in multiple types of working fields that makes life easier to live in.</p>
    <p>Aside from information, one can also use HTML in conjunction with other programming languages to do things that were only available in real life. For example, one could shop online at the comfort at their home at the time that they wanted in a safe, secure manner. Another example is to communicate with someone from access the world with online chat forums, and be able to attend school anywhere if you are taking an online class. The power of HTML creates countless opportunities for everyone.</p>
